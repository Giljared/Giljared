# Hey!🐬

My name is Gilvanete. I am graduated in Mathematics and post-graduated in Teaching in Higher Education. I'm passionate about Technology and that's why I make my career transition with great pride and energy! I love innovation and new paths and for that reason, I fully identify with this area. I act as Front-end.


### The easy has already been done. The difficult we are doing. We will do the impossible.🦋

🌏I was born in Alagoas. However, I grew up in Pernambuco. I currently live in the state of Rio Grande do sul. And I love change!
🪐I love the Universe.
🌈I share a little of my initial projects as a Front-End Developer.

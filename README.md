# Hey!🐬

## Link: https://github-linktree-gil-silva.netlify.app/

My name is Gilvanete. I have a degree in Mathematics and Physics, a postgraduate degree in Teaching in Higher Education, Data Science, ADS Analysis and Development of Systems and Programs and Technologies Applied to Education. I am passionate about Technology and that is why I make my career transition with a lot of dedication and energy! I love innovation and new paths and that's why I fully identify with another area in my professional journey. I work as Front-end and Data Science. And what else is possible?


### The easy has already been done. The difficult we are doing. We will do the impossible.🦋

🌏I was born in Alagoas. However, I grew up in Pernambuco. I currently live in the state of Rio Grande do sul. And I love change!
🪐I love the Universe.
🌈I share a little of my initial projects as a Developer.

## 🔖 Sobre

Linktree é um serviço online para Instagram que permite divulgar os links de todos os seus perfis e sites em um mesmo lugar. Porém, o linktree não oferece tantas opções de personalização, por isso decidi fazer o meu próprio linktree.
